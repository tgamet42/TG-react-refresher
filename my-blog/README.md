# Getting Started with Create React App using MongoDB and Axios in Node.JS with Express
 * Server backend functions for Thomas Gamet's refresher coding on React and client-server architectures.
 * "express": "^4.18.2" for middle HTML and CSS serving
 * "mongodb": "^5.0.1" for the back end
 * "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
 * 
 * Install MongoDB and create a my-blog-db database within it
 * Using MongoDB Compass add Collection Articles to my-blog-db and add data from ExampleArticlesForMongoDB.json
 * Using MongoDB Compass add Collection Users to my-blog-db and add data from ExampleUsersForMongoDB.json
 * The default MongoDB port number is assumed, and localhost is used, below
 * 
 * The API calls maintain a similar structure to the names of pages in which they are used.
 * 
 * Start this backend with npx nodemon src/server.js
 * Leave the default use of localhost and port 8000, or make appropriate changes
 * The setup is rather permissive, and only suitable or development use

* App.js as main() entry for Thomas Gamet's refresher coding on React and client-server architectures.
* Licensed under Apache 2.0.
* 
* Run this App with the following from my-blog
* npm run start
* 
* This is kept simple with default ports and localhost used in all cases. The CSS file is also simple.
* The App sets up a Navigation Bar (also kept simple) and routing for Home, About, Articles, each Article, and a Sign-In

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
